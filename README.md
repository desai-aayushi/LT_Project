# IOT based language using Lex/Flex and Yacc/bison
In this new Tech Era, everything is going to be wire less, but most important and interesting things will come in eveyones life and which is IOT. So our language is basically inspired from IOT things. So we have designed language, which is starting like "turn on/off any device" and after the answer we can have so many functions which you can use Ex. If you turn on A.C/Fridge/TV. Then and then you can use its functionalities like ex. set temperature , swing mode etc.
